        potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to
        prevent abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co - branded

        subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may disclose

        owners, third-party vendors, contractors and suppliers who perform
        services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information
        to do that service, or others in the good faith belief that such
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy
        Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other
        content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights,
        property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
        Straddle.site and its affiliates will share some or all of your personal
        information with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan
        to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a
        transaction occur, that other business entity (or the new combined
        entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to
        your personal information.
      </p>
      <h3>7. Personal Date Retention Period</h3>
      <p>
        Straddle.site will only keep your personal information for as long as it

        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements.) Upon request for account
        closure, your account will be closed but this closure will not involve
        deletion of historical records of the account for the reasons already
        stated. However, except as may be required by law or law enforcement
        agents and/or regulators, further processing of the personal information
        related to the account will cease from time of closure.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Security Precautions </h3>
      <p>
        Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss,
        misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Whenever
        you change or access your account information, we offer the use of a
        secure server. Once your information is in our possession we adhere to
        strict security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized access.
        However, please bear in mind that we cannot guarantee that the internet
        in itself is 100% secure and so we cannot take responsibility for the
        illegal acts of hackers as long as we have taken the necessary
        precautions. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        services is at your own risk. You should only access our site or
        services through and within a secure environment. Most importantly, you
        are responsible for keeping your User ID and password secure and you
        should not disclose them to anyone.
